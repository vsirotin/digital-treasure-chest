# Digital Treasure Chest

This project is intended as an incubator for libraries and tools I have developed that are useful in web application development. 
To test these tools in action, we need to have such an application. 

Programming up another “Hello World!” was not interesting to me. 
So I decided instead to fulfill one dream of my childhood: to create a “communist” store for mankind. A store where all goods would be absolutely free and never run out. 

From a technical point of view, this app is an example of using my libraries. 

First of all, it is localization of a small demo application into 30 most popular national languages on the Internet. Of course, I don't know that many languages myself, so the translation was done with the help of AI. But I hope that the translation is done well.

Secondly - demonstration of using the logging library.

Thirdly, a demonstration of the master data management library.  

You can see how this idea turned out [here](https://vsirotin.github.io/digital-treasure-chest/).
