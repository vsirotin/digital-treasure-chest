# BrowserLocalStorage

This TypeScript library is a facade (wrapper) on native mechanisms for storing and retrieving data locally in a browser.

From the user's point of view, it is a key-value object database with an additional level of hierarchy. In other words, key-value pairs are grouped into many groups in this database.

**Attention!** The library is not ready for use. Work in progress!
