# Digital Treasure Chest

This application is designed to fulfill the author's childhood dream - to give the people of Earth a store where all products will always be free and never run out.

I did this using the example of a store that trades in numbers.

At the same time, this application tests libraries from my freely available collection of TypeScript libraries.

Short overview of libraries from this project:

| Library Name          | Description                                                                                      |
|-----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Logger                | A simple logger for TypeScript, similar to Log4J, but with very restricted functionality.        |
| KeeperMasterData      | Supports the use and management of master data in web applications.                             |
| Localizer             | Supports localization in web applications by providing terms and texts in various languages.    |
| BrowserLocalStorage   | A facade on native browser mechanisms for storing and retrieving data locally.                  |

**Attention!** The application is not ready for use. Work in progress!
