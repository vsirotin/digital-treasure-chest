# Digital Treasure Chest

Programming up another “Hello World!” was not interesting to me. 
So I decided instead to fulfill one dream of my childhood: to create a “communist” store for mankind. A store where all goods would be absolutely free and never run out. 

From a technical point of view, this app is an example of using my libraries. 

First of all, it is localization of a small demo application into 30 most popular national languages on the Internet. Of course, I don't know that many languages myself, so the translation was done with the help of AI. But I hope that the translation is done well.

Secondly - demonstration of using the logging library.

Thirdly, a demonstration of the master data management library.  

You can see how this idea turned out [here](https://vsirotin.github.io/digital-treasure-chest/).
