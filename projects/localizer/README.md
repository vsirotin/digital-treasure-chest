# Localizer

This TypeScript library supports localization (using terms and texts in a given natural language) in web applications.

Before the needed information for a component in a specific natural language is used, it can be requested as a JSON file from this library. The library will attempt to find it in local storage. If it is not found, it will be requested from a specified web resource.
