# Logger

This library is a very simple logger for TypeScript, akin to Log4J, but with very restricted functionality.

This library allows outputting relevant information separated into classical levels (error, warning, info, debug) and configuring the output for a specific level, file, or a combination of both.

**Attention!** The library is not ready for use. Work in progress!
